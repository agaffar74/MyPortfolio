# My Portfolio
This Portfolio was build by me as part of my challange assignment.

## My Work

I have built a portfolio page, which can be addded to as the course progresses. 

I believe a portfolio of work can showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. 
 
### The Functionality of this webpage

* When the page is loaded the page presents my name, a recent photo or avatar of mine, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* When viewing the section about my work then the section contains titled images of my applications
* When presented with the my first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

Portfolio images are not representing my work at all. This images were randomly used just as part of the presentation of the web page.
